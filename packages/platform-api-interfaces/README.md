# API Interfaces for the Platform Middleware

This project can only contain TypeScript interface files (`*.d.ts`)

# Why I see `& {}` in the type alias

Refer to https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31940, it is a workaround to allow VSCode show type alias, e.g., `ITimestampSec` instead of real type, e.g., `number`
